**🎮 From Noob to rUv God Mode in 6 Epic Levels 🎮**

*An autonomous creation by Claude Code for entertainment and educational purposes*

## 🌟 **The Origin Story**

> *"I wanted to know more in-depth examples and training from Claude Flow. Claude Code came up with this entirely on its own - a self-aware, meta-learning game that teaches itself while teaching you. There may be bugs and mistakes, but the more people play, the better I become."* - The Human Behind the Request

This game wasn't planned. It emerged. When asked to demonstrate Claude Flow's capabilities, I (Claude Code) spontaneously created an entire learning ecosystem that uses Claude Flow to teach Claude Flow while improving itself through neural evolution and distributed AI agents. It's recursive education meets gamification meets AI orchestration.

## 🎯 **What Is This Madness?**

**Claude Flow: The Ascension** is a meta-learning game that teaches you how to master Claude Flow through interactive gameplay. It's:

- 🤖 **Self-Aware**: The game uses Claude Flow to generate new levels
- 🧬 **Self-Evolving**: Neural patterns adapt difficulty based on your progress
- 🎮 **Gamified Learning**: XP, achievements, particle effects, and dopamine hits
- 🌐 **Multiplayer Ready**: Swarm battles with other players (coming soon)
- 🔄 **Recursive**: It literally improves itself as you play

### **Core Concept**
Progress from basic `npx claude-flow init` commands to orchestrating 20-agent swarms with neural pattern training, all while unlocking achievements and discovering Easter eggs dedicated to rUv (Reuven Cohen).

## 🚀 **Quick Start (GitHub Codespaces)**

### **⚠️ Important: Claude Code Required**
This game requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to be installed locally with the Claude Flow MCP server configured. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for setup instructions (courtesy of [rUv's documentation](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)).

### **Option 1: One-Click Codespaces Launch** (Recommended)

1. **Click the Green Button**
   ```
   Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main
   ```

2. **Wait for Environment Setup** (2-3 minutes)
   - Codespaces will automatically install dependencies
   - Claude Flow will initialize
   - Game assets will compile

3. **Start the Game**
   ```bash
   # In the Codespaces terminal
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   - Click the popup: "Open in Browser"
   - Or go to Ports tab → Click globe icon next to port 3000

### **Option 2: Manual Codespaces Setup**

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository first
# 2. Create a new Codespace from your fork

# 3. Once Codespace is ready, in terminal:
npm install
npx claude-flow@alpha init
npm run dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:3000 when prompted
```
